The group of tech workers that filed a lawsuit on the STEM extension and got it vacated on a technicality has filed another one on the new STEM extension. Their argument is

* The OPT program denies labor protections to US workers. - This is despite the fact that the new STEM extension clearly states that a position filled under the STEM extension should not displace a US worker.
* It allows increased competition. - They had the same argument before.
* Allows unfair competition.
* Provides foregin students the benefit of mentoring programs. - This is not exclusive. US workers can get similar training too, I suppose.
* Violates procedural rights of US workers by failing to include the question of whether OPT should be expanded in the first place.
