  A mobile app to find an open parking spot.

The automated parking spot finder was an Arduino based system that notified on a web interface a grid of available parking spots categorized on permit levels. My responsibilities in this project included:

<ul>
	<li>Wrote code for the Arduino system to communicate the status of a spot to the central server.</li>
	<li>Designed and developed an API to "talk" with embedded devices to update parking spot status.</li>
	<li>Modified GUI to include parking lot switching.</li>
	<li>Developed an API using Twilio to receive texts and update the system based on the text content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a video demonstration of the working system.</p>
